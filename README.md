The library has not yet been released to maven central. To use it, clone the repository and run `mvn install`. 
This will install the library in your local repository.

### Implementing the South
To build a connector that is called by OBP-API you need to do three things:

  * Implement a version of the service provider interface
  * Pick an encoding (or implement your own)
  * Pick a transport (or implement your own) 

When not using this library to implement the south, all you need to do is look at the message format below and read and write those. The current version uses JSON and should be implementation language independent. (If not, please file a bug)

#### Implementing the SPI

If you want _(but there is no need to, see below)_ to do everything from scratch, 
all you need to implement is `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.Receiver`. 
It has one method:

```java
public interface Receiver
{
  String respond(Message request);
}
```

The request has an **id** and a **payload**.
The **id** is a `UUID` used to match the response to the request.
The **payload** is a request by OBP-API encoded in the encoding you choose, or 
that was choosen for you. 

The possible requests depend on the version of the SPI you are using.

For the `Version.Sep2016` the possible requests are listed 
in `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.AbstractReceiver`. 
The **AbstractReceiver** implements **Receiver** and has an abstract method for 
each request.

You need to subclass **AbstractReceiver** and implement these methods. 
This is an example for one of them:

```java
protected abstract String getBank(Decoder.Request r, Encoder e);
```

The first argument, of type **Decoder.Request** is used to decode the request.

The second argument, of type **Encoder** is used to encode the response.

Every request is implemented by `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.MockReceiver` 
used to test the **AbstractReceiver**. 
The Demo gives a more complete example: `com.tesobe.obp.demo.south.DemoData`.
A third test worth looking at because it implements the **North** and **South** 
sides is: `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.ConnectorTest`.

To get you started, you may use `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.DefaultReceiver`.
It has a no-op implementation of every method in AbstractReceiver.

### Implementing the North

(Look at `com.tesobe.obp.demo.SuperSimpleDemo` while you are reading this chapter)

The connector `com.tesobe.obp.transport.Connector` lists the methods you can 
call to communicate with external parties, the south. 

To optain a connector you need to implement `com.tesobe.obp.transport.Sender` 
and:

```java
import com.tesobe.obp.transport.Transport;

Transport.Factory factory = Transport.defaultFactory();
Decoder decoder = factory.decoder();
Encoder encoder = factory.encoder();
MySender sender = MySender(decoder, encoder);
Connector connector = factory.connector(sender);
```

The sender sends messages to the south and receives the responses.
If the south is local to the north, the sender only has one method to call on 
**MyReceiver**, an implementation of `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.Receiver`:

```java
MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver(decoder, encoder);
Sender = request -> receiver.respond(request);
```

For a simple but complete implementation of **Receiver** for testing see 
`com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.MockReceiver`.

Now, to use the **connector** simply call the methods, for example:

```java
String bankId = "...";
String userId = "...";

Optional<Bank> bank = connector.getBank(bankId, userId);
```

Examples for all methods in the connector are here: 
`com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.ConnectorTest`.

### The JSON Messages used by Default

The serializing and deserializing of data onto the transport medium is **specified** by two classes:

  * `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.Encoder`
  * `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.Decoder`
  
It is **implemented** using JSON by

  * `com.tesobe.obp.transport.json.Encoder`
  * `com.tesobe.obp.transport.json.Decoder`
   
These are the types messages sent and received

  * Request: Sent by the north, received by the south
  * Response: Sent by the south, received by the north
  * Error: Sent by the south, received by the north

The sender also encodes a messages, the receiver decodes, an exchange has the steps:

* North calls a connector method.
* The connector uses the encoder to create a JSON String.
* The sender creates a request message and sends it to the receiver.
* The receiver decodes the request and calls a method that south implements
* South gets the message call and creates a response, or an error.
* South has to use the decoder and encoder to get information from the request, or to put information into the response.
* The receiver sends the reponse to the sender.
* The sender decodes the response
*  North gets the result of the call.

By looking at `com.tesobe.obp.demo.SuperSimpleDemo` you can see all of the above in action.

Looking at the log messages produced by running `com.tesobe.obp.transport.spi.DefaultConnectorTest` will give you the JSON written by all requests and responses.

A **request** is a standard JSON object with two required JSON string keys, `name` and `version`. The values of these keys are required to be JSON strings. The South is expected to use these two keys to interpret the meaning and the other content of the request. Further keys will be present depending on context and request.

Any key may be omitted if it has no value.

These are the requests that return **zero** or **one** entity:

| Value of `name` Key | Additional Keys in Request | Keys in Response |
|----|----|----|
|  `get account` | `account` `bank` | `amount` `bank` `currency` `iban` `id ` `label` `number` `type` |
|  `get bank` | `bank` | `account` `bank` `logo` `name` `url` |
|  `get transaction` |  `account` `bank` `transaction` | `account` `balance` `bank` `completed` `description` `id` `other` `posted` `type` `value` |
|  `save transaction` | `account` `amount` `currency` `otherCurrency` `otherId` `transactionType` | |

These are the requests that return **zero** or **many** entities:

| Value of `name` Key | Additional Keys in Request | Response is an Array of JSON Objects with Keys|
|----|----|----|
|  `get accounts` | `bank` | *as in `get account` above*
|  `get banks` |  | *as in `get bank` above*
|  `get transactions` | `account` `bank` | *as in `get transaction` above*

All requests may include the `user` key that refers to the owner of the queried entities. 
When the `user` key is present the query is altered in a way that is **defined** by the south side. 
The basic understanding is that a query without a `user` key is **anonymous**. 
A query with a `user` key requests **only** entities that relate to the given user in some way defined by the south.

#####Get Transaction
These keys in the response have JSON objects as value

|Key | Keys in Value |
|----|----|
| `other` | `account` `id` |

The **completed** and **posted** keys are timestamps with this pattern: `"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ"`.

#####Save Transaction
The response is a single JSON string, the transaction id.

####The Above Again as EBNF
All messages are valid JSON.

## Design

This is a redesign of
[OBP-API project's](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API) `code.bankconnectors.Connector`.
The connector is used to communicate with extensions/plugins/backends that are
independently developed.

The goals are:

  * Support multiple versions of the API
  * Pluggable encoding of messages (defaulting to JSON)
  * Pluggable transports
    * Kafka
    * In memory (directly linked to OBP-API)
  * Easy testing
  * **Clearly label public and private data**
  * **Do not pass user data to anonymous methods**
  * Provide a demo

**Your feedback is very much appreciated**

Currently, the Kafka implementation is very simple, allowing only a single consumer and producer. 
The response must arrive before a the next request can be made.
My knowledge of Kafka is too limited to implement a higher throughput version.

## Kafka

We are using Kafka version **0.10.0.0**.
Start the servers and add the topics configured in your copy of OBP-API.
The names of the topics are specified in `OBP-API/src/main/resources/props/default.props`.
Substitute the name of your `.props` file. By default they are _Request_ and _Response_.

If there is no props file in `OBP-API/src/main/resources/props/`, then `default.props` copied from `sample.props.template` will do.
In the `.props` file these lines are required:

```
connector=kafka
kafka.zookeeper_host=localhost:2181
kafka.request_topic=Request
kafka.response_topic=Response
```

Create the topics

```
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic Request
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic Response
```

For testing reduce the retention time to, for example, one minute

```
bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --alter --add-config retention.ms=1000 --entity-name Request
bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --alter --add-config retention.ms=1000 --entity-name Response
```

Then start the server

```
cd OBP_API
mvn jetty:run
```

These are the default property files use by the south side demo:

```
obp-ri-demo/src/main/resources/com/tesobe/obp/demo/south/consumer.props
obp-ri-demo/src/main/resources/com/tesobe/obp/demo/south/producer.props
```

Command line flags for the south demo

```
java -jar obp-ri-demo/target/obp-ri-demo-2016.9-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
Option                             Description
------                             -----------
-?, -h, --help                     This message.
-c, --consumer <CONSUMER>          Consumer Configuration (default: consumer.
                                     props)
--consumer-topic <CONSUMER_TOPIC>  Consumer Topic (default: Request)
-p, --producer <PRODUCER>          Producer Configuration (default: producer.
                                     props)
--producer-topic <PRODUCER_TOPIC>  Producer Topic (default: Response)
```

Start the south demo

```
java -jar obp-ri-demo/target/obp-ri-demo-2016.9-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar&
```

Try a request

```
http://localhost:8080/obp/v2.0.0/banks
```

Checking compatability with OBP-API with `KafkaMappedConnector.scala`

```
curl -v -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/obp/v2.0.0/bank
curl -v -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/obp/v2.0.0/banks

```
